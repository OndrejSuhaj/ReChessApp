| **Trigger** | User requests aggregated progress data. |
| **Actors** | User<br>System |
| **Preconditions** | Valid access token is provided<br>User (ref:EN0005) exists |
| **Postconditions** | Aggregated LessonProgress data is returned |

## Main Flow

1. *User:* sends authenticated request for progress data  
2. *System:* validates access token  
3. *System:* loads LessonProgress records (ref:EN0006) for User  
4. *System:* calculates completed lesson count  
5. *System:* returns progress summary and lesson status list  
End

## 2A: Invalid Access Token

- *System:* rejects request  
End

## 3A: No Progress Records

- *System:* returns completed count = 0  
- *System:* returns empty progress list  
End

## Notes on Implementation Constraints

- Aggregation must not modify LessonProgress  
- Deterministic lesson execution must remain independent
